1 -	Extract scite archive in plugins/scintilla/scintilla directory (or 
	make a symlink (ln -s from to) if you already have scintilla elsewhere).
	
2 -	In the build directory, run: "make update-scintilla" 

3 -	Run "git status" in plugins/scintilla/scintilla directory to check
	newly added files (particulary LexXXX.cpp files). Add them in git.
	
4 -	Proceed as usual: check for errors during build and commit.
